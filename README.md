Welcome to my experimental website repository!

I am a mechanical engineer with a strong interest in software development. In this space, I'm trying to learn, experiment and have fun in the field of web development. GitHub Pages provides an excellent (and free) platform for hosting my project.

Feel free to explore my work and witness my progress in real-time. I'm always open for feedback and suggestions.
